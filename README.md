# Farmhouse Table | Restaurant Website

I created this application based on a coding challenge at Frontend Mentor which I modified to have it personalized.
It is a restaurant landing page based on 2 pages, one homepage and one booking page. The whole app is fully responsive based on mobile first principles.
